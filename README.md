# dkModal

## An angular module for creating modals

### Purpose of this project
This isn't that end-all solution to all your modal concerns, then again... that's exactly what it is. The idea behind this is:

* simple code that's easy to understand so easy to hack on
* you create the modal you want/need from this, i.e. this is just a starting point, a very good starting point that works right out of the box, but that can easily be shaped into what you really want, the code being simple and readable.

 I need a grid like this too, so will come up with the dk-grid one of these days. Just something that has all the boilerplate code for paging, sorting, local data, remote/data, simple pager option, but be easily extendable to morph into whatever you really need for that specific use.

### Todo:
