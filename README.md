# dkModal

## An angular module for creating modals

### Purpose of this project
This isn't that end-all solution to all your modal concerns, then again... that's exactly what it is. The idea behind this is:

* simple code that's easy to understand so easy to hack on
* you create the modal you want/need from this, i.e. this is just a starting point, a very good starting point that can be shaped into what you really want: dont' like the &times; in the corner, put in a font icon, move it around. Want different animation? change it. Get it? Instead of reading tons of documentation to figure out all the millions of options, how about something relatively simple that's easy to understand, so... easy to modify. Then "you" make the modifications yourself.

 I need a grid like this too, so will come up with the dk-grid one of these days. Just something that has all the boilerplate code for paging, sorting, local data, remote/data, simple pager option, but be easily extendable to morph into whatever you really need. Not something so complex that it intimidates you. There's a sweet spot out there where if you keep the code simple and understandable, people will feel they can hack it into what they want. If you try to account for any modifications they may want, the complexity grows to where it's no longer modifiable. The complexity of all the options scares people away, not to mention the documentation that goes on and on.

### Todo:

**this readme**

**demo page that makes it easy to test out all features including:**
